--------------------------------- MODULE Raft ---------------------------------
(* NOTES 
Author: Jack Vanlightly
This specification is based on (with heavy modification) the original Raft specification 
by Diego Ongaro which can be found here: https://github.com/ongardie/raft.tla 

This is a model checking optimized fork of original spec.

- Summary of changes:
    - updated message helpers:
        - prevent resending the same message multiple times (unless explicity via the duplicate action)
        - can only receive a message that hasn't been delivered yet
    - optimized for model checking (reduction in state space)
        - removed history variables (using simple invariants instead)
        - decomposed "receive" into separate actions
        - compressed multi-step append_entries_req processing into one.
        - compressed timeout and requestvote into single action
        - server directly votes for itself in an election (it doesn't send itself a vote request)
    - fixed some bugs
        - adding the same value over and over again
        - allowing actions to remain enabled producing odd results
    
Notes on action enablement.
 - Send is only enabled if the mesage has not been previously sent.
   This is leveraged to disable actions once executed, such as sending a specific 
   AppendEntrieRequest. It won't be sent again, so no need for extra variables to track that.

EXTENDS Naturals, FiniteSets, Sequences, TLC

\* The set of server IDs
CONSTANTS Server

\* The set of requests that can go into the log
CONSTANTS Value

\* Server states.
CONSTANTS Follower, Candidate, Leader

\* A reserved value.
CONSTANTS Nil

\* Message types:
CONSTANTS RequestVoteRequest, RequestVoteResponse,
          AppendEntriesRequest, AppendEntriesResponse

\* Used for filtering messages under different circumstance
CONSTANTS EqualTerm, LessOrEqualTerm

\* Limiting state space by limiting the number of elections and restarts           
CONSTANTS MaxElections, MaxRestarts
----
\* Global variables

\* A bag of records representing requests and responses sent from one server
\* to another. TLAPS doesn't support the Bags module, so this is a function
\* mapping Message to Nat.
VARIABLE messages
----
\* Auxilliary variables (used for state-space control, invariants etc)

\* The values that have been received from a client and whether
\* the value has been acked back to the client. Used in invariants to
\* detect data loss.
VARIABLE acked
\* Counter for elections and restarts (to control state space)
VARIABLE electionCtr, restartCtr
auxVars == <<acked, electionCtr, restartCtr>>
----
\* Per server variables (functions with domain Server).

\* The server's term number.
VARIABLE currentTerm
\* The server's state (Follower, Candidate, or Leader).
VARIABLE state
\* The candidate the server voted for in its current term, or
\* Nil if it hasn't voted for any.
VARIABLE votedFor
serverVars == <<currentTerm, state, votedFor>>

\* A Sequence of log entries. The index into this sequence is the index of the
\* log entry. Unfortunately, the Sequence module defines Head(s) as the entry
\* with index 1, so be careful not to use that!
VARIABLE log
\* The index of the latest entry in the log the state machine may apply.
VARIABLE commitIndex
logVars == <<log, commitIndex>>

\* The following variables are used only on candidates:

\* The set of servers from which the candidate has received a vote in its
\* currentTerm.
VARIABLE votesGranted

candidateVars == <<votesGranted>>

\* The following variables are used only on leaders:
\* The next entry to send to each follower.
VARIABLE nextIndex
\* The latest entry that each follower has acknowledged is the same as the
\* leader's. This is used to calculate commitIndex on the leader.
VARIABLE matchIndex

leaderVars == <<nextIndex, matchIndex>>

\* End of per server variables.
----

\* All variables; used for stuttering (asserting state hasn't changed).
vars == <<messages, serverVars, candidateVars, leaderVars, logVars,
          auxVars>>
view == <<messages, serverVars, candidateVars, leaderVars, logVars >>
symmServers == Permutations(Server)
symmValues == Permutations(Value)
----
\* Helpers

\* The set of all quorums. This just calculates simple majorities, but the only
\* important property is that every quorum overlaps with every other.
Quorum == {i \in SUBSET(Server) : Cardinality(i) * 2 > Cardinality(Server)}

\* The term of the last entry in a log, or 0 if the log is empty.
LastTerm(xlog) == IF Len(xlog) = 0 THEN 0 ELSE xlog[Len(xlog)].term

\* Add a message to the bag of messages.
Send(m) == 
    /\ m \notin DOMAIN messages
    /\ messages' = messages @@ (m :> 1)

SendMultiple(msgs) ==
    /\ \A m \in msgs : m \notin DOMAIN messages
    /\ messages' = messages @@ [msg \in msgs |-> 1]    

\* Explicit duplicate operator for when we purposefully want message duplication
Duplicate(m) == 
    /\ m \in DOMAIN messages
    /\ messages' = [messages EXCEPT ![m] = @ + 1]

\* Remove a message from the bag of messages. Used when a server is done
\* processing a message.
Discard(m) ==
    /\ m \in DOMAIN messages
    /\ messages[m] > 0 \* message must exist
    /\ messages' = [messages EXCEPT ![m] = @ - 1]

\* Combination of Send and Discard
Reply(response, request) ==
    /\ messages[request] > 0 \* request must exist
    /\ response \notin DOMAIN messages \* response does not exist
    /\ messages' = [messages EXCEPT ![request] = @ - 1] @@ (response :> 1)

\* The message is of the type and has a matching term.
\* Messages with a higher term are handled by the
\* action UpdateTerm
ReceivableMessage(m, mtype, term_match) ==
    /\ messages[m] > 0
    /\ m.mtype = mtype
    /\ \/ /\ term_match = EqualTerm
          /\ m.mterm = currentTerm[m.mdest]
       \/ /\ term_match = LessOrEqualTerm
          /\ m.mterm <= currentTerm[m.mdest]

\* Return the minimum value from a set, or undefined if the set is empty.
Min(s) == CHOOSE x \in s : \A y \in s : x <= y
\* Return the maximum value from a set, or undefined if the set is empty.
Max(s) == CHOOSE x \in s : \A y \in s : x >= y

----
\* Define initial values for all variables

InitCandidateVars == votesGranted   = [i \in Server |-> {}]
\* The values nextIndex[i][i] and matchIndex[i][i] are never read, since the
\* leader does not send itself messages. It's still easier to include these
\* in the functions.
InitLeaderVars == /\ nextIndex  = [i \in Server |-> [j \in Server |-> 1]]
                  /\ matchIndex = [i \in Server |-> [j \in Server |-> 0]]
InitLogVars == /\ log          = [i \in Server |-> << >>]
               /\ commitIndex  = [i \in Server |-> 0]
InitAuxVars == /\ electionCtr = 0
               /\ restartCtr = 0
               /\ acked = [v \in Value |-> Nil]

Init == /\ messages = [m \in {} |-> 0]

\* ACTION: AppendEntries ----------------------------------------

\* Changelog:
\*
\* 2014-12-02:
\* - Fix AppendEntries to only send one entry at a time, as originally
\*   intended. Since SubSeq is inclusive, the upper bound of the range should
\*   have been nextIndex, not nextIndex + 1. Thanks to Igor Kovalenko for
\*   reporting the issue.
\* - Change matchIndex' to matchIndex (without the apostrophe) in
\*   AdvanceCommitIndex. This apostrophe was not intentional and perhaps
\*   confusing, though it makes no practical difference (matchIndex' equals
\*   matchIndex). Thanks to Hugues Evrard for reporting the issue.
